    "This notebook illustrates a simple technique which can be used to reduce the number of continuous parameters in mixed integer optimization problems. We use this technique to convert an instance of the unit commitment problem with $n$ units to a problem with a single continuous parameter and $n$ binary parameters. This problem can then be solved with a Quantum-Classical optimization techinque, in which the continuous parameter is optimized over in a classical outer loop, while the binary parameters are fixed using a quantum computer. The problem of solving for optimal binary parameters given fixed continuous parameters is then equivalent the knapsack problem, which is discussed in a separate notebook. "

    "Near-term quantum computers are unlikely to be able to encode the continuous variables present in the unit commitment problem. Consequently, attempts at solving the unit commitment problem on a quantum computer will rely on hybrid techniques, in which a classical optimization technique fixes the continuous parameters in the problem, and another, possibly quantum, optimization techinque fixes the problem's binary variables. Ideally this hybrid approach results in a binary optimization problem which preserves some of of the unit commitment problem's original hardness, while reducing the ammount of data that would need to be encoded on the quantum computer. \n",
    "\n",
    "We first describe a simple hyrbid approach to solving the unit commitment problem, then refine it. We first make a small rewrite to formulation of the UC problem, where the continuous variables in the problem give the power output of each unit *if it is turned on*, while the binary variables describe which units are turned on. Letting $\\xi$ denote the optimal solution to the UC problem, we then have \n",

    "\n",
    "Critically this formulation also reveals a \"two-loop\" structure to the unit commitment problem. The outer loop involves a minimization of the continous variables $p_i$, while the inner loop minimizes over the binary $y_i$ variables. Once $p_i$ variables have been set, the remaining problem is a purely binary optimization problem -- which is equivalent to the knapsack problems after a few sign flips. \n",
